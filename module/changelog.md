## TEESimulator-RS v6.0.1-251

14 commits since v6.0.0-235. Clears the remaining Duck Detector grant-domain rows (incl. the Android 16 OnePlus report), restores Google Wallet and fingerprint compatibility, and removes the in-module patch-level/bulletin resolvers. Test device (SDK 35) TEE tamper score 28 → 8.

### Detection coverage
- Grant plane virtualized: owner read and cross-app `Domain.GRANT` read return one identical chain. 6 RED rows cleared. (28 → 18)
- Generate-mode fingerprint: dropped 2 surplus authorizations (both patchlevels), USER_ID moved to SOFTWARE to mirror a captured device. (18 → 8)
- Android 16 grant: patch-mode keys now served on the grant plane, so owner and grant reads match — fixes CHAIN_SPLIT.
- Grant gated to SDK ≥ 36: Android 15 answers PERMISSION_DENIED, no synthetic over-capability.
- Stale-chain eviction: import and updateSubcomponent drop the cached attestation; no pre-mutation chain replays.
- Lifecycle coherence: clearNamespace / deleteAllKeys / migrateKeyNamespace mirror synthetic key and grant state — defeats delete-then-read probes.
- Device-ID attestation mirrors the real TEE: returns CANNOT_ATTEST_IDS where silicon can't attest, instead of forging it.

### App compatibility
- Google Wallet: INCLUDE_UNIQUE_ID stripped (not rejected) when the caller lacks the permission; card binding works. (PR #27)
- Fingerprint / vendor keys: KEY_ID miss skips the post-handler, so real HAL operations are no longer wrapped and broken. (PR #26)

### Removed
- PatchLevelManager — auto-resolved the security-patch date from an installed PlayIntegrityFix module (with hot-reload) and applied it to props.
- BulletinPoller — scheduled security-bulletin refresh.

### Other
- Release builds purge stale `teesim-*.bin` diagnostics from `/data/local/tmp` at boot.
- Vol-key confirmation rewritten to 1s `getevent` bursts (piped stream missed single presses on Magisk).

### Verified
- SDK 35, Xiaomi 23106RN0DA: tamper 28 → 8; generate-mode signal gone; 4 grant rows UNAVAILABLE (correct for Android 15); no regressions.
- Android 16 grant fix built but unconfirmed on SDK 36 — needs an affected OnePlus user to confirm the grant rows clear.

## TEESimulator-RS v6.0.0-235

11 commits since v6.0.0-224. Duck Detector generate-mode fingerprint cleared. Shizuku-routed BYO attestation fixed. Vol-key confirmation restored on Magisk.

### Detection Coverage
- Duck Detector "TEE Simulator generate-mode fingerprint" cleared. `toAuthorizations` reordered to AOSP keymint reference order; KEY_SIZE moves from auth#4 to auth#2, breaking the byte-224 anchor the probe relied on. 0/31 matches on fresh self-probes (was 15/36).
- `persist.logd.size` variants blanked at boot via `service.sh`. Removes a logd-tuning side-channel.

### BYO & Shizuku Routing
- Shizuku-routed BYO attestation no longer fails with `-49 UNSUPPORTED_TAG`. `shouldSkipUid` moved into `handleGenerateKey`, evaluated after BYO parameters are parsed.
- `createOperation` parallel fix: outer UID gate removed; the cache-or-forward lookup is the sole gate. BYO keys created under Shizuku UID can now be used for signing under the same UID.
- `forceGenerate` simplified: any attest-key or BYO request routes to software unconditionally.
- BYO attest-key miss returns the full keybox chain instead of a malformed depth-1 chain.
- AUTO TEE race dispatch removed. Resolution uses `DeviceAttestationService.isTeeFunctional` only.
- Symmetric gen rejects `attestationKey != null` early with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Unsupported-algorithm branch returns `-38` instead of `-49`.

### Action Button
- Vol+ / Vol- confirmation restored on Magisk. Streaming `getevent -lq` matched inline against `KEY_VOLUMEUP DOWN` / `KEY_VOLUMEDOWN DOWN`, wrapped in `/system/bin/timeout 10`. The prior polled approach timed out on six-events-per-keypress kernels.

### Verified
- Android 15 (SDK 35), daemon PID 1466.
- Cross-device confirmation pending on OnePlus PKX110 and Samsung SM-S928B.

## TEESimulator-RS v6.0.0-224

59 commits since v6.0.0-162. Self-sufficient spoofing infrastructure, Duck Detector TamperScore-4 cleared on Xiaomi A16, persistent symmetric key storage (PR #22), 22-language action button hardening.

### Detection Coverage
- Duck Detector TimingSideChannelProbe cleared on Xiaomi A16 (SDK 35). Timing ratio dropped 1.555x to 1.055x, verdict WARNING to CLEAR. Threshold is > 1.1x.
- `KEY_ID` resolved from `teeResponses` instead of synthesized, matching real KeyMint binder behavior.
- Non-attested key cache mirrors attested path for byte-level metadata parity.
- `KEY_SIZE` emitted for EC keys; omitted when `ecCurve` is present, matching AOSP attestation_record.h.
- SSE messages synthesized canonically on non-AEAD `updateAad`; passthrough shape normalized.
- StrongBox attest version no longer hardcoded; resolved from device context.
- TEE op latency floor enforced to defeat micro-timing probes.
- Attest key resolution restored to nspace-aware lookup after revert/restore cycle.

### Self-Sufficient Spoofing
- `PatchLevelManager` resolves OS/VENDOR/BOOT patch levels via PIF without external bulletin fetch.
- `BulletinPoller` refreshes bulletin data on a schedule, isolated from boot path via umbrella `try/catch`.
- Bootloader-lock props pushed via `resetprop` at boot; absent vbmeta complement props filled; `vbmeta.device_state` included.
- PIF hot-reload via `FileObserver`; empty source files skipped; future patch dates bounded by `MAX_FUTURE_DAYS`.
- Default `security_patch.txt` dropped at install time.
- `sepolicy.rule` allows UDP egress for DNS resolution.

### Key Persistence (PR #22)
- Symmetric keys persist across reboots with byte-identical metadata.
- Keybox edits no longer wipe stored keys.
- Delete marker dropped on key regeneration to prevent stale state.
- Defensive symmetric fallback path with clean error codes.

### Reliability
- `atomicWrite` preserves `[pkg]` sections; errors guarded in `updateTo`.
- `applyToProps` serialized against concurrent callers.
- `pollOnce` wrapped in umbrella `try/catch`; `BulletinPoller.start` failure isolated from spoofer init.
- Spoofer ordering fixed: runs before keystore hook to prevent attest-time prop drift.
- `isAutoMode` reads raw package mode; `system=prop` passive default respected.
- `mergedContents` propagates read errors instead of swallowing them.
- Date regex validation on `currentPatch`; YYYY-MM input skips day synthesis.
- Global key-assignment check requires `=` delimiter (no more partial matches).
- `validation_rejected` status emitted on invalid spoof input.

### Action Button UX
- Vol+ required to clear `persistent_keys`. Vol- cancels. 10-second timeout defaults to cancel.
- Confirmation localized in 22 languages: ar, az, bn, de, el, es-ES, fa, fr, id, it, ja, ko, pl, pt-BR, ru, th, tl, tr, uk, vi, zh-CN, zh-TW.
- Every echoed string resolves through `_msg()` against device locale.

### Build & Ops
- Kotlin `jvmTarget` raised to JVM 21.
- Gradle auto-rewrites `module/update.json` on packaging.
- `scripts/package.sh` locates user-local cargo; rust task receives cargo bin path.
- Verified on Xiaomi Android 16 (SDK 35) `v6.0.0-224-Release`. Daemon alive PID 1392. Pending cross-device confirm on OnePlus PKX110 (qcom sun) and Samsung SM-S928B (pineapple).

## TEESimulator-RS v6.0.0

Repository consolidation release. All tee-rebuild work merged as the new main branch.

### AOSP Self-Signed Cert Compliance
- No-challenge keys now generate self-signed certs (subject == issuer, depth 1), matching AOSP `ta/src/keys.rs:451-478`
- Both Kotlin (BouncyCastle) and Rust (native-certgen) paths corrected
- Eliminates attestation behavioral probes that detect keybox issuer on non-attested keys

### Stability
- Binder stress crash hardening for concurrent generateKey calls
- AUTO mode TEE race for consistent attestation on devices with working G10
- Oversized transactions routed to software gen instead of crashing
- Operation-time params (BLOCK_MODE, PADDING, DIGEST) passed through to CipherPrimitive

### Banking App Compatibility
- Bare `target.txt` entries now default to AUTO mode, resolved at config level to PATCH (working TEE) or GENERATE (broken TEE)
- Fixes BHIM and similar banking apps that require TEE-backed attestation keys
- Restores v5.0 behavior where AUTO was resolved before the interceptor dispatch, avoiding the non-deterministic `raceTeePatch` path

### Infrastructure
- Version scheme changed to semver (v6.0.0)
- Repository moved to TEESimulator-RS as canonical source

---

## TEESimulator-RS v5.0: AOSP Compliance Overhaul

Major release integrating 30+ AOSP compliance improvements from upstream PR #157 analysis, layered on top of our StrongBox hardening and native cert gen architecture.

### Attestation Extension Alignment
- 17 enforcement tags added to KeyMintAttestation (ACTIVE_DATETIME, ORIGINATION_EXPIRE, USAGE_EXPIRE, USAGE_COUNT_LIMIT, CALLER_NONCE, UNLOCKED_DEVICE_REQUIRED, INCLUDE_UNIQUE_ID, ROLLBACK_RESISTANCE, EARLY_BOOT_ONLY, ALLOW_WHILE_ON_BODY, TRUSTED_USER_PRESENCE_REQUIRED, TRUSTED_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED, NO_AUTH_REQUIRED, MAX_USES_PER_BOOT, MAX_BOOT_LEVEL, MIN_MAC_LENGTH, RSA_OAEP_MGF_DIGEST)
- BLOCK_MODE encoded as SET OF INTEGER per AOSP attestation_record.h
- Version-guarded tags (RSA_OAEP_MGF_DIGEST >=100, ROLLBACK_RESISTANCE >=3, EARLY_BOOT_ONLY >=4)
- INCLUDE_UNIQUE_ID computed via HMAC-SHA256 per KeyMint HAL spec using device HBK
- AAID gated on attestation challenge presence
- Certificate validity defaults aligned with AOSP (epoch notBefore, 9999-12-31 notAfter)

### Binder Infrastructure
- Native transaction code filtering at C++ level, skipping JNI for non-intercepted codes
- getNumberOfEntries includes software-generated key count
- deleteKey resolves KEY_ID domain via generatedKeys lookup
- patchAuthorizations for OS/VENDOR/BOOT patch levels in authorization arrays

### Software Operation AOSP Conformance
- updateAad on non-AEAD operations returns INVALID_TAG (-76), matching AOSP operation.rs
- All crypto exceptions wrapped as ServiceSpecificException with correct KeyMint error codes
- GCM IV returned in CreateOperationResponse.parameters for encrypt operations
- SoftwareOperationBinder methods @Synchronized, matching AOSP Mutex per operation
- authorize_create enforcement: PURPOSE validation, algorithm-purpose compatibility, temporal constraints, CALLER_NONCE prohibition, WRAP_KEY rejection

### Security and Configuration
- SELinux permission checks via /proc/pid/attr/current
- Per-UID permission verification through IPackageManager.checkPermission
- Imported key tracking prevents stale attest-key overrides in getKeyEntry
- nspace consistency fix in attest-key override path
- TeeLatencySimulator with log-normal distribution matching real hardware profiles
- Device-unique HBK seed generated on install (32 bytes from /dev/random)

### Preserved from v4.8
- StrongBox op limits (4 concurrent max, TOO_MANY_OPERATIONS rejection)
- LRU operation pruning per security level
- Hardware keygen rate limiting (2/30s sliding window, 2 concurrent cap)
- Native Rust cert generation with BouncyCastle fallback
- Key persistence across reboots

---

## TEESimulator-RS v4.8.1: StrongBox Op Rejection Fix

- **StrongBox op limit gate fix** — `trackAndEnforceOpLimit` was only called in the `Domain.KEY_ID` not-found path, so software-generated keys (found via `Domain.APP`) bypassed `STRONGBOX_MAX_CONCURRENT_OPS=4` entirely. DuckDetector's concurrent signing handles test created 24+ operations that all succeeded via LRU pruning instead of being rejected with `TOO_MANY_OPERATIONS (-29)`. Now enforced for all StrongBox createOperation paths.

---

## TEESimulator-RS v4.8: StrongBox Hardening & LRU Pruning

Tested against DuckDetector on OnePlus (Android 16, KSU). Tamper score dropped from 32 to 8.

- **LRU operation pruning** — Concurrent software operations capped at 15 per UID (TEE) and 4 per UID (StrongBox), with oldest-first eviction. Pruned operations return `INVALID_OPERATION_HANDLE (-28)`, matching AOSP keystore2 malus-based pruning.
- **StrongBox param guard** — Unsupported StrongBox params (RSA >2048-bit, non-P256 EC curves) forwarded to real HAL for proper rejection instead of generating in software.
- **StrongBox timing** — Key generation floors at 250ms, signing at 80ms on StrongBox security level to match real secure element latency.
- **StrongBox op limit** — Sliding-window enforcer caps concurrent StrongBox operations for both software and hardware key paths, returning `TOO_MANY_OPERATIONS (-29)` when exceeded.
- **ECDSA algorithm alias** — Accept "ECDSA" in addition to "EC" as JCA private key algorithm name. Fixes SIGSEGV crash on Android 10 devices where the provider reports EC keys as "ECDSA". Closes #4.
- **createOperation domain handling** — Software-generated keys now found via both `Domain.APP` (alias) and `Domain.KEY_ID` (nspace) lookup paths.
- **Permission guards** — Device ID attestation tags (IMEI, MEID, serial) require caller permission checks.

---

## TEESimulator-RS v4.7: Operation & Attestation Fixes

Tested against [KeyDetector](https://github.com/XiaoTong6666/KeyDetector) and [Key Attestation](https://github.com/nickel-lang/nickel) on OnePlus (Android 16) and Xiaomi Redmi 14C (Android 14).

- **PADDING encoding** — Fixed ASN.1 encoding of PADDING tag in attestation extension from individual `[6] INTEGER` entries to `[6] SET OF INTEGER`, matching AOSP `attestation_record.h` schema. Broke all RSA key attestation since v4.6.
- **Operation error-path conformance** — Software operations now track finalized state and return `INVALID_OPERATION_HANDLE (-28)` on post-abort calls. Input length guard (32KB) returns `TOO_MUCH_DATA` matching AOSP `operation.rs`. Passes KeyDetector's OperationErrorPathChecker.
- **updateAad support** — Added `updateAad` to `SoftwareOperationBinder`, fixing `AbstractMethodError` on Android 16 where the runtime Stub declares it abstract.
- **Algorithm inference** — `createOperation` now infers algorithm from the stored key pair when operation params omit the ALGORITHM tag, matching AOSP behavior.

---

## TEESimulator-RS v4.6: Rebrand & Detection Fix

- **RTT normalization rework** — Replaced Gaussian sleep (mean=55ms) with a 15ms floor fence. The old approach triggered Chunqiu Native Check 2.8 timing analysis; the floor-only approach satisfies the minimum RTT threshold without creating a detectable delay pattern.
- **Cross-algorithm attestation** — Signing algorithm now derived from the attestation key's actual type, not the generated key's algorithm. Fixes BouncyCastle crash when signing RSA keys with EC attestation keys (Shizuku attestation flow).
- **Device ID attestation** — Serial/IMEI/MEID/secondImei tags now flow through to software cert gen instead of blanket rejection. Only DEVICE_UNIQUE_ATTESTATION is rejected, matching AOSP keystore2 policy.
- **Rebrand to TEESimulator-RS** — Distinguishes this fork from upstream. Version scheme simplified to v{major}.{minor}-{commitCount}.
- **CI streamlined** — Release pipeline uses Gradle-generated filenames directly, eliminating the rename step.

---

## TEESimulator v4.5: Detection Hardening

Tested against [KeyDetector](https://github.com/XiaoTong6666/KeyDetector) (23-check attestation validator). All keystore-level checks now pass.

- **Key deletion consistency** — After deleting a software-generated key, `getKeyEntry` now correctly returns `KEY_NOT_FOUND` instead of falling through to a stale live-patch fallback. Fixes binder consistency checks that detect ghost key responses.
- **generateKey timing normalization** — Software key generation RTT now matches real TEE latency profile (Gaussian distribution, mean=55ms, floor=15ms). Previously completed in ~4ms, which is an immediate timing side-channel.
- **Delete cleanup scope** — `deleteKey` now clears all cached state (patched chains, attestation keys) regardless of whether the key was software or hardware-generated.

---

## TEESimulator v4.4: AOSP Conformance

- **Binder error reply format** — Aligned EX_SERVICE_SPECIFIC wire layout with AOSP Status.cpp, including the remote stack trace header field.
- **Key enumeration** — Corrected list_past_alias pagination order to match AOSP database.rs semantics.
- **KeyMetadata fields** — Generated key responses now include modificationTimeMs, Tag.ORIGIN, and normalized KeyDescriptor fields per AOSP Keystore2.
- **Parcel handling** — hasException() preserves reply position for downstream consumers.

---

## TEESimulator v4.3: Performance & Reliability

- **Debug log gating** — `SystemLogger.debug()` now skipped entirely in release builds, eliminating unnecessary logcat syscalls on every intercepted transaction.
- **Supervisor backoff** — Exponential restart delay (500ms → 30s cap) prevents CPU spin if the daemon crashes repeatedly. Resets automatically once stable.
- **Process priority** — Daemon runs at nice=10, yielding CPU to foreground apps on constrained devices.
- **Map eviction** — Rate limiter and file lock maps now evict stale entries instead of growing unbounded.
- **CI pipeline** — Single-trigger build→release pipeline with proper changelog extraction and correctly sized artifacts.

---

## TEESimulator v4.2: Detection Evasion Hardening

Fixes 6 detection vectors flagged by attestation validator apps.

### Attestation Policy Enforcement

Replicate AOSP keystore2's `add_required_parameters()` validation that our software keygen path was bypassing:

- **CREATION_DATETIME** — Reject caller-provided input with `INVALID_ARGUMENT (20)`, matching `security_level.rs:424`. Our cert gen still adds its own timestamp, same as real keystore2.
- **Device ID attestation** — Reject ATTESTATION_ID_SERIAL, IMEI, MEID, SECOND_IMEI, and DEVICE_UNIQUE_ATTESTATION with `CANNOT_ATTEST_IDS (-66)`. No consumer app has READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE.
- **Error reply format** — Fixed AIDL ServiceSpecificException parcel write order (was errorCode→message, now message→errorCode).

### Certificate Fix

Leaf certificate Subject CN corrected from "Android KeyStore Key" to "Android Keystore Key" (lowercase s), matching AOSP `KeyGenParameterSpec.java:282`. Both Kotlin and Rust paths.

### Binder Timing

Skip interception for system transaction codes (PING, INTERFACE, DUMP) above LAST_CALL_TRANSACTION. Eliminates the JNI round-trip that inflated binder ping ratio to 3.85x (detector threshold: 3.0x).

---

## TEESimulator v4.1: Boot Identity Persistence

Bugfix release. The vbmeta boot key digest was randomizing on every reboot, producing a different RootOfTrust in attestation certificates each boot.

On devices where the kernel doesn't set `ro.boot.vbmeta.public_key_digest`, the fallback chain hit random generation every boot because `resetprop` overrides for `ro.boot.*` props don't survive reboots. Added file-based persistence (`boot_hash.bin`, `boot_key.bin`) between the TEE cache and random fallback. Once determined, boot identity values persist across reboots.

Verified on Redmi 14C: second boot reads from persistent file instead of regenerating.

---

## TEESimulator v4.0: Native Rust Cert Generation

Major release. Certificate chain generation rebuilt from the ground up in Rust, replacing the BouncyCastle Java path for EC and RSA keys. Hardened against every known detector app.

### Native Cert Generation

The headline feature. `libcertgen.so` generates X.509 certificate chains using `ring` (EC-P256/P384) and `rsa` (RSA-2048/4096) with manual DER assembly. No more BouncyCastle quirks — issuer/subject DN bytes are injected directly from the keybox, ensuring byte-perfect chain linkage. BouncyCastle remains as fallback for unsupported curves (P-224, P-521, Curve25519).

### Anti-Detection Hardening

- **Challenge validation** — Oversized attestation challenges (>128 bytes) now return `INVALID_INPUT_LENGTH (-21)`, matching real KeyMint behavior. Previously accepted silently — DuckDetector exploited this.
- **Per-UID rate limiter** — 2 hardware keygens per 30s burst, 2 concurrent max. Overflow falls back to software certs. Blocks DuckDetector-style keygen flooding that starves GMS.
- **importKey eviction guard** — Retained patch chains prevent generate-then-import attacks that evict cached attestation data.
- **256KB native payload cap** — Oversized binder payloads bypass interception cleanly instead of stalling threads.
- **Alias size rejection** — Oversized key aliases rejected before they hit the binder buffer.

### Key Persistence

Generated keys now survive reboots. File-backed storage with file-level locking, preserved across keybox rotations. Banking and biometric apps that cache attestation keys no longer break after restart.

### Attestation Fixes

- Null out all-zero `verifiedBootHash` from TEE cache (fingerprinting vector)
- Correct `module_hash` field to match AOSP Keystore2 format
- Override pre-existing attest keys instead of skipping them
- Strip HTML comments from PEM blocks in keybox parsing
- Security patch consistency — `system=prop` forces boot/vendor to match

### Module Lifecycle

- Supervisor daemon keeps the interceptor alive
- KSU Action button clears persistent key cache
- Clean uninstall removes all traces (persistent keys, TEE status, daemon)

### Stability

- FileObserver NPE on config deletion fixed
- Global uncaught exception handler — daemon stays alive on unexpected errors
- PEM parsing hardened against malformed keybox files

### Tested Against

DuckDetector, Luna, Play Integrity, Key Attestation Demo — all passing on Redmi 14C (Android 14, Beanpod KeyMaster, KSU).
